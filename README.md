SPF13 is a distribution of Vim that comes pre-built with the plugins and dotfile modifications you need to be a productive developer. Installing it on Linux, FreeBSD, and OS X is remarkably simple. Just open up a terminal and run:

`curl http://j.mp/spf13-vim3 -L -o - | sh`

Then, let do what it has to do. Once it’s finished, you’ll have a turbo-charged Vim install. 

If you’re on Windows, read the instructions on the SPF13 website.
Using SPF13 doesn’t stop you from configuring Vim to how you like it, however. Just edit the .vimrc dotfile as required.
